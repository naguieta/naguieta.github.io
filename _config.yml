  I am a software developer in the
  mainframe environment with 7 years
  of experience in C and Assembler
  languages, and 3 years as a Functional
  Analyst.
  I have led teams, primarily analyzing,
  designing, and managing projects,
  training new developers, and
  participating in system migrations
  from command centers in different
  parts of the world.
  Recently, I completed my studies to
  embark on my path as a Data Scientist,
  enhancing my knowledge and
  acquiring essential tools for application
  in this field.
  I am drawn to challenges and complex
  tasks. I enjoy pushing myself to
  improve and learning new tools and
  strategies to apply in my work.
